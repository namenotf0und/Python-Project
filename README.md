 1. Auto.py (Automation)
    --> This code is a Python program that allows users to automatically delete files based on specific extensions from a folder. The program also provides a graphical interface (GUI) using tkinter, making it easy to use even by people with no technical background.
    --> Many users often have folders with unwanted files, such as temporary files (.tmp), logs (.log), or certain types of files that need to be deleted periodically. Performing manual deletion for files with specific patterns is time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, an automated tool that is intuitive and user-friendly is required.
