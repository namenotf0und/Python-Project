 1. Auto.py (Automation)
    --> This code is a Python program that allows users to automatically delete files based on specific extensions from a folder. The program also provides a graphical interface          (GUI) using tkinter, making it easy to use even by people with no technical background.
    --> Many users often have folders with unwanted files, such as temporary files (.tmp), logs (.log), or certain types of files that need to be deleted periodically. Performing         manual deletion for files with specific patterns is time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, an automated tool that is intuitive and user-friendly is required.

2. Scraping_steam (Automation)
   --> This code is a Python program for web scraping game data by genre from the Steam platform. This program uses requests and BeautifulSoup modules for scraping data from the         Steam website and provides a graphical interface (GUI) using tkinter to make it easier for users to use.
   --> Steam is one of the largest digital game distribution platforms. With thousands of games available, users often need game data by genre to:
       Conduct market analysis.
       Help players find games relevant to their preferences.
       Help developers understand trends in specific categories.
       However, this data is not always available in an easily accessible format. With this program, data from Steam can be extracted and stored for various purposes.
